# Artificial_Copy_Editor

The task is to create the model (artificial copy editor), understand it in problem - solution basis:
Problem: 
1)  A model in which if i input a paragraph then it remove all the grammatical mistakes of the paragraph.

2) Furthermore user can further transform the paragraph into writing style of any author's of his choice. kind of author filters so if a third person will read it then it feels like the author wrote this paragraph. 

Creation:
Author filter: every author has its unique style of writing for example Kafka, Mark Twain etc so the author filter is the model can be trained by the writings of any famous author(user selects or use as input) then use this trained model to change any para or article written by the user. 

For example I like the writings of Shakespeare so I use his book/literary-pieces as input to train my model then now I can use this trained model to change my article or para.
